## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology                 |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Frontend     | React (TypeScript Ready)   |
| Drag & Drop  | [`@dnd-kit`](https://dndkit.com) |
| Styling      | Tailwind CSS               |
| UI Components| ShadCN UI, Lucide Icons    |
| Image Handling| next/image (for optimization) |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- `SortableItem` uses `useSortable()` from **@dnd-kit** to register the card as a draggable item.
- `CSS.Transform.toString()` is used to animate card position updates smoothly.
- State is managed with React hooks (`useState`) for edit toggling, content changes, and conditional rendering.
- Reusable components like `Card`, `Badge`, and `DropdownMenu` make it scalable.

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Responsiveness of dynamic draggable cards | Used Tailwind’s grid/flex layout + `DnD Kit` transform utilities |
| Preventing drag interference with buttons/editing | Used `e.stopPropagation()` on interactive elements |
